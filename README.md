# Anova Precision Oven for Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration for the Anova Precision Oven (APO) using Anova's [official developer API](https://developer.anovaculinary.com/docs/devices/wifi/oven-commands). Real-time telemetry via WebSocket (`wss://devices.anovaculinary.io`), plus basic control.

> **Provided as-is. No warranty. No expectation of maintenance, support, or future updates.** This is a personal project shared in case it's useful to someone else. You are responsible for verifying correct behavior -- particularly when automating against a physical cooking appliance.

## Scope

Full read-only telemetry for the oven (22 sensors and binary sensors). Limited control: on/off, target temperature, and the lamp. Complex cooking (multi-stage recipes, steam, custom heating element combinations, timer, fan/vent) should be driven from the Anova app. See [Climate Entity Behavior](#climate-entity-behavior) before automating against the climate entity.

### Supported

- Anova Precision Oven v1 (tested)
- Anova Precision Oven v2 (untested; reads should work, the cook-start path sends extra fields the API docs suggest v2 requires)

### Not Supported

Anova Precision Cooker (APC sous vide circulator). That's a different product with a different API -- use the built-in [Anova integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/anova) in HA core.

## Entities

### Sensors (17, read-only)

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| Dry temperature | Current dry bulb temperature |
| Wet temperature | Current wet bulb temperature |
| Probe temperature | Meat probe temperature (when connected) |
| Humidity | Current relative humidity |
| Timer | Cook timer remaining (seconds) |
| Mode | `idle` / `preheat` / `cook` |
| Dry / Wet / Probe temperature setpoint | Target temperatures from whatever cook is running |
| Humidity setpoint | Target humidity percentage |
| Fan speed | Current fan speed percentage |
| Rack position | Current rack position |
| Timer start type | `Immediately` / `When preheated` / etc. |
| Heating elements | `Top` / `Bottom` / `Rear` / combinations / `All` / `Off` |
| Firmware / Hardware version | Diagnostic |
| Cook session | Current cook session ID or `idle` |

### Binary Sensors (4, read-only)

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| Connectivity | Online / offline |
| Door | Open / closed |
| Water tank | Empty (problem) + `descale_required` attribute |
| Vent | Open / closed |

### Climate (1)

`OFF` and `HEAT` HVAC modes, target temperature 25-250 C. See [Climate Entity Behavior](#climate-entity-behavior).

### Switch (1)

Lamp on/off.

## Climate Entity Behavior

The climate entity is intentionally simple. Every `turn_on` or temperature change starts a **new single-stage cook** with these fixed parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Mode | Dry (no steam) |
| Heating elements | Top on, Bottom off, Rear on |
| Fan speed | 100% |
| Humidity setpoint | 0% |
| Vent | Closed |
| Timer | None (indefinite) |

`turn_off` sends `CMD_APO_STOP`.

**Caveat:** if a multi-stage or steam cook is in progress (started from the Anova app), changing the HA climate target will **replace** it with the simple dry cook above. Anova's API has no "adjust current cook" command. Treat the climate entity as a "turn on to X" shortcut; use the app for structured recipes.

## Installation

### HACS

1. In HACS, open the three-dot menu and select **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/wrongdoug/ha-anova-precision-oven` as an **Integration**
3. Install "Anova Precision Oven" and restart HA

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/anova_precision_oven/` into your HA config's `custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Configuration

**Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Anova Precision Oven**, then paste your Personal Access Token (starts with `anova-`).

Tokens are documented in Anova's [authentication guide](https://developer.anovaculinary.com/docs/devices/wifi/authentication). Max 10 PATs per account. WebSocket connections time out after 30 minutes of inactivity; the integration auto-reconnects.
